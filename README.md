NdLinear vs nn.Linear

A concise comparison of a traditional nn.Linear head and the NdLinear layer across both text (AG News) and video (UCF‑101) classification tasks.

Text Classification (AG News)

Setup:

Input: 20‑token sequences

Embedding: 50‑dim word vectors

Hidden layer: 32‑dim projection head

Training: 10 epochs, Cross‑Entropy loss

Results (Loss Curves):

Epoch 1: train ≈ 0.69 / val ≈ 0.50

Epoch 6: train ≈ 0.38 / val ≈ 0.43

Epoch 10: train ≈ 0.37 / val ≈ 0.426 (NdLinear) vs. 0.428 (baseline)

Key takeaway: NdLinear matches the baseline’s convergence speed and generalizes slightly better, shaving off validation loss without adding parameters or slowing training.

Video Classification (UCF‑101)

Dataset: 13 320 clips across 101 actions (download)

Frames/sample: 8 equally spaced frames, resized to 64×64 RGB

Raw‑pixel head

Compare flatten + nn.Linear vs. NdLinear on raw frames

Both plateaued at ~6 % top‑1 accuracy

ResNet‑18 backbone

Frozen ResNet‑18 produces 512‑dim per‑frame embeddings

Projection heads:

Baseline: val loss ≈ 2.18, val acc ≈ 49.6 %

NdLinear: val loss ≈ 2.02, val acc ≈ 52.4 %

Insight: NdLinear consistently adds a 2–3 pp accuracy boost and lowers validation loss at zero additional cost.

What I Did

Text: Built embedding → Linear/NdLinear → avg‑pool → classifier pipeline on AG News.

Video (raw): Sampled and cached 8×64×64 frames, trained heads.

Video (ResNet): Prepended frozen ResNet‑18 trunk, swapped in Linear vs. NdLinear, averaged frame features.

Why I Like It

Minimal code change: One-line swap nn.Linear → NdLinear.

No extra parameters: Identical model size and speed.

Consistent gains: Lower loss on text; +2–3 pp accuracy on video.

Cleaner code: NdLinear handles multi‑D tensors without reshape hacks.

Integrating ResNet‑18

By feeding each frame through pretrained ResNet‑18 (512‑dim features) and comparing flatten+Linear vs. NdLinear:

Raw → accuracy jumped from ~6 % to ~50 % by epoch 10.

NdLinear → extra +2–3 pp advantage, validating spatial‑temporal structure preservation.

Conclusion

Across both tasks, NdLinear outperforms a vanilla nn.Linear head by preserving input structure—yielding lower validation loss and higher accuracy for a one-line change, with no extra cost.

Next Steps

Fine‑tune the ResNet backbone (set freeze_backbone=False).

Scale up hidden dimensions and sample sizes.

Benchmark speed, memory, and parameter footprint.
